This project is mostly about routing. TheShoeDepot is an online store(not really...) which sells shoes from the world top brans such as Nike, UnderArmour, Reebok and Adidas.

The data is stored in the "shoes.json" in the data folder. Each page imports the shoe onject and then destructure it according to it's own needs. 

Using routing we were able to create to multi-page websites. 

To top it off scroll animation is added by React-Reveal.

More to come.
